If they are not high enough up, they will radiate upwards, and reflect on the ionosphere--this is called NVIS. Functionally, it means you have less-than-best-case reach, but this may be desired for certain operators (ie, if you'd like to get people somewhat closer, but outside of line-of-sight--and therefore want to use HF). NVIS works on lower HF bands such as 80m and 40m where ionospheric reflection is at a maximum. A typical NVIS setup is a low half-wave dipole less than 1/8th wavelength high.

AM modulation modulates the amplitude of a carrier signal with the sound waves you want to transmit; this results in one very strong carrier and two peaks around it of RF energy (sidebands). SSB works by lopping off both the carrier and one sideband, so that the same amount of RF energy is focused on less bandwidth, increasing efficiency."
